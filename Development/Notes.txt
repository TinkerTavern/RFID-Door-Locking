Face Detection:
- 

+ A little faster (if needed)

Arduino-PC Comms:
- Read the actual data
- 

+ If we want, we can use HM 10 modules for extra comms with PC and phones
+

LED Matrix:
- Points to current focus (camera, tag or questions)
- If wrong, X mark, happy face if right

Documentation:
- Write about the sections you do AS YOU GO ALONG (but not in big detail) 
- References
-


Features:
- Face Detection
- Arduino-PC Comms
- Arduino-Arduino comms
- RFID Scanner
- LED Matrix
- Screen and buttons (maybe numpad)
- Speakers (synchronised)



Potential problems:
- Not enough pins
- Comms issues


Questions:
- What happens when the user enters a wrong answer or wrong tag.

Camera first
Then Tag
Then Question

We thouhgt we wouldn't have enough pins for our project, however some research (LINK), shows that the analogue in pins can in fact be used
We thought about using a shift register for other components.. thoughts later
