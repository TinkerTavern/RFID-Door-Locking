Slave Arduino:
	To start connect
	5v ---> EN
	Rx ---> Rx
	Tx ---> Tx
	Send empty sketch to arduino (with Rx/Tx disconnected)
	As arduino starts up hold button on side of arduino
	Open Serial monitor at 38400 Baud and both NL & CR
Commands Sent:
	AT + UART --- this should show 38400
	AT + ROLE? --- this should show 0
	AT + ADDR? -- should give an address, save this for master

Master Arduino:
	To start connect
	5v ---> EN
	Rx ---> Rx
	Tx ---> Tx
	Send empty sketch to arduino (with Rx/Tx disconnected)
	As arduino starts up hold button on side of arduino
	Open Serial monitor at 38400 Baud and both NL & CR
Commands Sent:
	AT + UART --- this should show 38400
	AT + ROLE = 1 --- this should show "ok" and will set it to master
	AT + CMODE = 0 --- connect mode to fixed address
	AT + BIND = Address --- address seperated by commas not colons
				this is attaching the address to be connected to 

now when done disconnect 5v ---> EN 
			 connect RX and TX on module to pins you want on arduino
