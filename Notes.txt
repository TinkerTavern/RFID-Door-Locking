Face Detection:
- 


+ A little faster (if needed)

Arduino-PC Comms:
- Read the actual data
- 

+ If we want, we can use HM 10 modules for extra comms with PC and phones

Potential problems:
- Not enough pins
- Comms issues


Questions:
- What do when wrong


We thouhgt we wouldn't have enough pins for our project, however some research (LINK), shows that the analogue in pins can in fact be used
